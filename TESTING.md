# Testing Strategy

This document maps the [zudo-test-wisdom](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-test-wisdom)
framework onto this repo concretely. It is the authoritative reference for what to run,
when, and why.

---

## Archetype

**SSG-emitting-runtime + static docs, pre-release.**

zudo-sg is a documentation site built with zfb (a Vite/Preact SSG framework). The
generator side is CLI-shaped (T0–T1 sufficient); the emitted runtime (islands, client
router) is covered by T0 unit tests today, with L4 E2E coverage added in T1.

---

## Tiers in Use

| Tier | Status | What runs |
|------|--------|-----------|
| T0 | Active | typecheck + unit tests — inner loop, constant feedback |
| T1 | Active | PR CI gate: lint-tokens + codegen-drift + typecheck + unit + build + build-demo + smoke-e2e + dist-checks + file-provider-e2e |
| T2 | Not needed | T1 budget is well under 10 min; no split needed |
| T3 | Deferred to release | see below |
| T4 | Local b4push only | convenience pre-push pass (not enforcement) |

---

## Test Levels

| Level | What | Tools | Command |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| L1 | Unit / logic | vitest | `pnpm test:unit` |
| L4 | E2E browser smoke | Playwright | `pnpm test:e2e` |
| L5 | Visual / computed-style | `/verify-ui` skill | ad-hoc, not in CI |

---

## Commands

### T0 — Inner loop (run constantly while implementing)

```bash
pnpm check        # TypeScript typecheck (zfb check)
pnpm test:unit    # vitest unit tests
```

### T1 — Local pre-push gate

```bash
pnpm b4push       # runs all steps below in order
```

Steps in `scripts/run-b4push.sh`:

1. Format check (mdx) — `pnpm dlx @takazudo/mdx-formatter --check .`
2. Design token lint — `pnpm lint:tokens` (owned by S2; no-op pass until S2 merges)
3. Type checking — `pnpm check`
4. Unit tests — `pnpm test:unit`
5. Build — `pnpm build`
6. Build demo — `pnpm --filter @zudo-sg/demo build`
7. Link check — `pnpm check:links` + `pnpm check:links:demo`
8. HTML validation — `pnpm check:html`
9. Playwright smoke e2e — `pnpm test:e2e` (styleguide + the 7 composer projects +
   demo-smoke — see [Composer E2E suites](#composer-e2e-suites))
10. Manual interactive smoke (operator-driven)

### T1 — CI gate (authoritative)

The `pr-checks.yml` workflow runs on every PR targeting `main` or `base/**` and is
the single source of truth for pass/fail. Jobs mirror the b4push steps:

- **lint-tokens** — `pnpm lint:tokens` (no-op until S2)
- **codegen-drift** — `pnpm check:z-index` + `pnpm check:sg-registry` +
  `pnpm check:token-manifest`
- **typecheck** — `pnpm check`
- **unit** — `pnpm test:unit`
- **build** — `pnpm build` (produces and caches `dist/`)
- **build-demo** — `pnpm --filter @zudo-sg/demo build` (produces and caches
  `apps/demo/dist`), then `pnpm check:links:demo` against it
- **smoke-e2e** — `pnpm test:e2e:ci` (Playwright, Chromium only; styleguide +
  the 7 composer projects + demo-smoke — see
  [Composer E2E suites](#composer-e2e-suites); needs `build` and `build-demo`)
- **dist-checks** — `pnpm check:links` + `pnpm check:html` against `dist/`
  (needs `build`; merged into one job so both checks share a single install)
- **file-provider-e2e** — `pnpm test:e2e:composer-file` (Playwright, dev-server-backed
  file provider suite; no `needs`, builds its own `zfb dev` server from source — see
  [Composer E2E suites](#composer-e2e-suites))

### Individual checks

```bash
pnpm check              # typecheck
pnpm test:unit          # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm build              # build site → dist/
pnpm --filter @zudo-sg/demo build  # build demo site → apps/demo/dist/
pnpm check:links        # broken internal link check (needs dist/)
pnpm check:links:demo   # broken internal link check for the demo (needs apps/demo/dist/)
pnpm check:html         # HTML validation (needs dist/)
pnpm test:e2e           # Playwright smoke (needs dist/ and apps/demo/dist/)
```

### Composer E2E suites

`playwright.config.ts` (the default config, run by `pnpm test:e2e` / `pnpm test:e2e:ci`)
includes 7 composer projects alongside `smoke`, `preview-token-panel`, and `demo-smoke`.
The composer projects, like `smoke` and `preview-token-panel`, are served from the
styleguide's static `dist/` preview (port 4700) — `demo-smoke` is separate, served from
`apps/demo/dist` on port 4701:

| Project | Spec | Covers |
|---------|------|--------|
| `composer` | `composer.spec.ts` | 14-step editor walkthrough — canvas/tree edits, chooser, inline text edit, copy/paste/cut/duplicate, cross-slot drag, storage & recovery matrix, SPA navigation guard |
| `composer-prose` | `composer-prose.spec.ts` | Explicit-save prose editing (epic #368): the hashed `zfb-md-wasm` runtime loading from the BUILT site, the no-implicit-commit contract (Enter/blur/mode-switch never commit; ESC and click-away prompt), the `focusout` host-chrome path, dialog focus containment, the untouched plain auto-commit path, persistence across reload, and dual-theme computed styles |
| `composer-persistence` | `composer-persistence.spec.ts` | Real-browser IndexedDB lifecycle (create/update/duplicate/delete) and legacy-storage migration |
| `composer-production-boundary` | `composer-production-boundary.spec.ts` | Built preview exposes IndexedDB but no dev file capability, endpoint, UI, or destination writes |
| `composer-contracts` | `composer-contracts.spec.ts` | Composer Polish S7 computed-style contract gate (panel separation, chooser dialog, tree geometry, accent census, typography floor, narrow-viewport overflow) |
| `composer-verification` | `composer-verification.spec.ts` | Viewport/theme/a11y matrix and interaction/state semantics (touch + mobile) |
| `composer-reuse` | `composer-reuse.spec.ts` | Global-template and Pattern reuse — publish, discover, insert, dependency-checked unpublish, detach flows (touch + mobile) |

Three composer-specific config files exist outside the default config, each with its own
server/port and script — `composer-file`'s script runs in CI (see below); the
`composer-verification` and `composer-persistence` scripts are local-only:

| Config | Port | Server | Projects | Script |
|--------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| `playwright.composer-file.config.ts` | 4702 | `zfb dev` (filesystem transport, via `scripts/run-composer-file-e2e-server.mjs`) | `composer-file-provider` | `pnpm test:e2e:composer-file` |
| `playwright.composer-verification.config.ts` | 4704 | `zfb preview` | `composer-verification`, `composer-contracts`, `composer-reuse` | `pnpm test:e2e:composer-verification` (all three); `pnpm test:e2e:composer-reuse` (just `composer-reuse`) |
| `playwright.composer-persistence.config.ts` | 4703 | `zfb preview` | `composer-persistence`, `composer-production-boundary`, `composer-adapted` (`composer.spec.ts`) | `pnpm test:e2e:composer-persistence` |

`playwright.composer-file.config.ts` is the only composer suite that can't run against a
static `dist/` preview — it needs `zfb dev`'s filesystem write transport, which is exactly
the surface `composer-production-boundary` asserts is absent from the built preview.

**CI vs local, precisely:**

- CI runs the reuse spec through the **default-config `composer-reuse` project**, inside
  the `smoke-e2e` job (`pnpm test:e2e:ci`) — it does **not** invoke
  `pnpm test:e2e:composer-reuse`. That isolated script (on
  `playwright.composer-verification.config.ts` @4704) is a local-only command.
- `composer-file` runs in its own `file-provider-e2e` CI job
  (`pnpm test:e2e:composer-file`), since it needs a live `zfb dev` server rather than a
  `dist/` preview.
- `pnpm test:e2e:composer-verification` and `pnpm test:e2e:composer-persistence` are not
  invoked by CI at all — they're local-only debugging entry points.

`composer-prose` exists ONLY in the default config: it needs the static `dist/` preview
(that is where the hashed wasm assets are served the way production serves them) and it
mutates one record serially, so an isolated debugging twin would add nothing.

This is a **deliberate overlap**: `composer-persistence`, `composer-production-boundary`,
`composer` (as `composer-adapted`), `composer-verification`, `composer-contracts`, and
`composer-reuse` all exist both in the default config (parallel workers, one shared dist
server, run in CI) and in the isolated 4703/4704 configs (`workers: 1`, serial database
mutations, run locally) — the isolated configs give a deterministic, single-worker
environment for debugging persistence/reuse flakes without the noise of the full parallel
suite.

**E2E support modules** (not test files themselves):

- `e2e/support/composer-persistence.ts` — IndexedDB constants (database/store names, the
  legacy storage key, composer route paths) and fixture helpers for opening a persisted
  record.
- `e2e/support/composer-reuse.ts` — reuse document/node builders and constants
  (`SOURCE_RECORD_ID`, `PATTERN_RECORD_ID`) for Global-template and Pattern flows.

> The `pr-checks.yml` job comments (job list, ordering, `needs` wiring) are owned by the
> Composer CI epic — this section describes the resulting test surface, not the workflow
> file itself.

## Pre-commit Hook (lefthook)

`lefthook.yml` installs a `pre-commit` hook that auto-formats staged `.md` / `.mdx`
files with `@takazudo/mdx-formatter`. The hook is installed automatically on
`pnpm install` via the `prepare` script.

---

## T3 Deferral — Scheduled Re-exam

**T3 (scheduled rich CI) is deferred until release.** This is a deliberate, time-boxed
decision per the test-wisdom execution-tiers guide:

> For a project that has not yet shipped to users, T3 can be deferred. Standing up T3
> early is not cost-justified: hosted-macOS Actions minutes and self-hosted GPU runners
> cost real money for a project nobody uses yet.

For zudo-sg specifically:

- No `exam.yml` nightly workflow is scaffolded.
- No GPU/macOS/WebKit CI lanes.
- Visual regression (L5) and platform-specific keyboard tests run ad-hoc via `/verify-ui`
  and `/headless-browser` skills, not as scheduled CI jobs.

**Adopt T3 at or after first public release**, when the project has users whose
regressions justify the standing infrastructure cost. At that point:

- Add `exam.yml` with a nightly cron trigger.
- Add a macOS runner lane for WebKit / platform-specific tests.
- Wire `scripts/file-exam-issue.sh` for deduplicated failure issue filing.

See [Scheduled Re-exam and Night Exam](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-test-wisdom)
for the concrete T3 implementation pattern.

## Allowlists

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.check-links-allowlist` | Known broken internal links to suppress in `check:links` |
| `.htmlvalidate.json` | html-validate rule configuration |

---

## Adding Tests

- **Logic / data transforms** → add to `src/**/__tests__/` as `*.test.ts`, picked up by vitest automatically.
- **New E2E flows** → add `*.spec.ts` to `e2e/`. Styleguide flows go in the port-4700 smoke fixture; demo flows go in the port-4701 demo-smoke fixture (see `playwright.config.ts`). Composer flows default to a `composer*` project in `playwright.config.ts` (static `dist/` preview) — only reach for one of the composer-specific configs when the flow needs something the default config can't give it: filesystem-write/dev-transport coverage → `playwright.composer-file.config.ts`; an isolated, single-worker run for verification/contracts/reuse debugging → `playwright.composer-verification.config.ts`; the same for persistence/production-boundary/full-walkthrough debugging → `playwright.composer-persistence.config.ts`. See [Composer E2E suites](#composer-e2e-suites).
- **Visual regression** → use `/verify-ui` skill ad-hoc; do not add L5 specs to CI until T3 is set up.
- **Anything asserting DOMPurify output** → put `@vitest-environment jsdom` in the file's leading docblock. Under the repo-wide happy-dom environment (16.8.1) DOMPurify reports `isSupported: true` yet sanitizes nothing — `<script>` and `onerror=` pass through verbatim — so an XSS assertion there would be testing a sanitizer that never ran. `packages/ui/src/content/prose-md/markdown-runtime.ts` refuses such a DOM outright (it probes the sanitizer before trusting it) and returns `html: null` with a `sanitize` error diagnostic, so the symptom is a null result rather than unsafe HTML.
