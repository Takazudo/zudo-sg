// Public surface of the central Composer app (issue #251).
//
// `ComposerIntegration` is the production app entry (mounted by
// `chrome/composer-app.tsx` → `pages/composer/index.tsx`'s island).
// `useComposerIntegration` is the callback/state composition seam waves 6-9
// (#254-#258) extend. The shared chooser instance is mounted inside
// `ComposerIntegration`; the main canvas bridge lives in `ComposerCanvasHost`
// (instance-scoped — a second host can be mounted for #254's chooser preview).
