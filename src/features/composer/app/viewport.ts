// Canvas viewport widths + persistence for the central Composer app (#251).
//
// The Composer owns a Desktop/Tablet/Mobile/Fluid canvas viewport control. The
// choice sizes ONLY the preview iframe's width (which reflows the preview
// document) — it never changes the surrounding Composer responsive breakpoint
// (issue #251 scope item 5). The preview session protocol (#248) carries no
// viewport field, so the width is applied to the parent-side iframe host here,
// not sent as a message.
//
// The choice is persisted to localStorage (like the rail widths in
// resizer-contract.ts) so it survives a reload, and every access is guarded so
// blocked/private-mode storage degrades to the default rather than throwing.
