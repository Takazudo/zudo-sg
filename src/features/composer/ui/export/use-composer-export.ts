// Convenience hook wiring #245's `generateJsx` to open/close state for the
// export dialog (issue #249). Deliberately tiny and fully owned by this
// feature: it's the one place `generateJsx` is called from the
// presentational layer, so wave-5 integration (#251) can either use this
// hook directly or call `generateJsx` itself and pass the result straight
// into `ComposerExportDialog` — both paths render the exact same generator
// output, never a second render/source mapping. `result` is never copied
// into further local state anywhere downstream — it's held once, here.
//
// The document arrives as a GETTER, not a captured value (issue #291): the
// integration passes the controller's `flushPropUpdates`, so a
// debounce-pending inspector edit is landed synchronously — and its result
// read back in the same tick — before JSX generation. A captured `document`
// prop could not express that: it would still hold the pre-flush render's
// snapshot when `openExport` runs.
