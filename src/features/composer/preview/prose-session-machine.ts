// ── Explicit-commit prose editing session (issue #374, epic #368) ───────────
//
// A PURE, DOM-free state machine for canvas inline edits of a field whose
// contract declares `inlineEdit.mode: "markdown-source"` (#372). The renderer
// integration (#375) owns every DOM concern: it feeds stimuli in and executes
// the returned effects. Nothing here reads the DOM, the bridge, or a clock.
//
// This is a PARALLEL session path. The auto-commit inline session in
// `renderer.ts` (#257 / #288) — Enter commits, blur commits, Edit→Preview
// commits — stays exactly as it is and drives `inlineEdit.mode: "plain"`
// (the default). The two never share state.
//
// ── The contract ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NO IMPLICIT COMMITS, EVER. There is no auto-commit on blur, no Enter-to-
// commit, and the Edit→Preview auto-commit that the plain session performs
// does NOT apply here. Exactly two stimuli can produce a `commit` effect:
//   1. `save-click`   — the floating Save button (bottom-right, outside the
//                       editable area);
//   2. `dialog-choice { dialog: "leave", choice: "save" }` — the explicit Save
//                       option in the leave dialog.
// Both route through the SAME single `commit` output, so the integration has
// one commit function, not two. (Epic #368 records the interpretation: "saving
// only via that button" bans *implicit* commits; the leave dialog's explicit
// Save is per the user's own spec. Dropping it is a one-line change here plus
// its tests.)
//
// ESC and click-away PROMPT rather than silently losing or silently committing
// a draft:
//   - `escape` while dirty → the ESCAPE dialog: [Discard changes / Keep
//     editing]. No Save — ESC is a discard gesture and the dialog merely
//     confirms it. Dismissing that dialog with ESC means "keep editing", the
//     safe default (the integration maps dialog-ESC to the raw `escape` input,
//     which this machine treats as keep-editing while a dialog is open).
//   - `outside-intent` while dirty (mousedown elsewhere in the iframe, or
//     focus leaving to host chrome) → the LEAVE dialog: [Save / Discard /
//     Keep editing]. The triggering outside action is CONSUMED, not replayed:
//     after choosing, the user clicks their target again. Replaying it would
//     mean holding a DOM event across an async dialog and re-dispatching it
//     into a tree the choice may have just re-rendered.
//   - any leave stimulus while NOT dirty → silent exit, no prompt.
//
// A commit whose value is unchanged from session start is suppressed (the
// session just ends). That is not merely an optimisation: a no-op commit still
// advances the document revision host-side, which would make a later REAL
// commit fail the session-start staleness gate and silently drop the user's
// edit. Same reasoning as `commitInline` in `renderer.ts` (#288).
//
// ── The session-start revision ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `startRevision` is captured ONCE, at session start, and carried on the draft
// verbatim into every `commit` effect — including a commit made from a stashed
// draft after a mode switch. It is never re-read or refreshed, so a render that
// lands mid-edit makes the eventual commit STALE by construction and the host's
// revision gate rejects it. Re-stamping a commit as fresh merely because it was
// sent after that render is exactly the bug #288 fixed.
//
// ── Two accepted limitations (documented, deliberate silent discards) ───────
//
// 1. EXTERNAL VALUE CHANGE on the field being edited (the #288 "ground moves
//    under you" case) discards a dirty draft SILENTLY, with no prompt. The
//    draft is unsaveable anyway — its session-start revision is now stale, so
//    the host's gate would reject a commit — and prompting would offer a Save
//    that cannot work. A render that leaves this field alone does not end the
//    session.
// 2. NODE REMOVED (the edited node is gone from the document) discards a dirty
//    draft SILENTLY. There is no longer a target to commit into, and the
//    prompt would be attached to a component that has left the canvas.
//
// Every OTHER way a dirty draft can be dropped goes through an explicit dialog
// choice. `__tests__/prose-session-machine.test.ts` asserts both properties
// exhaustively over the reachable state graph.
