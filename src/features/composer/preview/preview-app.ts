// The client-only app that runs INSIDE the Composer preview iframe.
//
// It is the trusted side of the boundary: it imports the Composer runtime
// registry (#244) itself, so the real component functions are resolved HERE and
// never travel over the bridge. What crosses the bridge is JSON only.
//
// Boot order matters. The listener is installed BEFORE `ready` is announced, so
// the parent's answering snapshot can never arrive before anything is listening.
// Because `ready` is emitted on every load, a late load or a reload replays the
// parent's newest snapshot (see `bridge.ts`) — and the freshly booted state
// starts at revision `-1`, so it accepts it.
//
// Written with `h()` rather than JSX for the same reason as `renderer.ts`: a
// root-`src` `.tsx` module cannot be imported by the current vitest config
// (owned by #247), and keeping this JSX-free keeps it testable.
