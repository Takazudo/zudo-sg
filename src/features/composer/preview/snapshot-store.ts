// The preview iframe's snapshot state + the REVISION GUARD.
//
// Pure, DOM-free, and Preact-free on purpose: revision ordering is the part of
// this feature most likely to break silently (a late `render` overtaking a
// newer one after a reload, a re-delivered message re-applying an old document),
// so it is a plain function that can be exhaustively tested without a renderer.
//
// The rule is one line: a message is applied only when its revision is STRICTLY
// greater than the revision currently on screen. The parent mints revisions
// monotonically (`bridge.ts`), so "greater" means "newer", and a stale snapshot
// can never win — including the replay the parent sends after the iframe
// reloads and re-announces `ready`.
